## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

# Cars Data set

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

*This dataset contains information about the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. The data was collected in 1920s.*

*It has 50 rows and 2 variables.*

# Pressure v Temperature

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Pressure Data Plot'}
plot(pressure, xlab = ' Temperature (deg C)', ylab = 'Pressure (mm)')
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Data Plots

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
dist <- cars[ , 2]
speed <- cars[ , 1]
hist(dist, main = 'Histogram of Stopping Distance', xlab = 'Stopping Distance')
plot(speed, dist,main = 'Stopping Distance v Speed', xlab = 'Speed', ylab = 'Stopping Distance')
```

Plot Improvements

-   Adding color to the plots would make them more visually appealing

-   Instead of circles in the scatter plot I would like to be able to change it to dots to mark each of the points

Tip

For the modification I changed the main font of the document and changed it to Roboto.
